# AppyBot
## The official GitHub repository for Appy - a powerful tool for verifying new users in your Discord server!

To use Appy, simply invite it to your server and run /setup. Appy's convenient and efficient user interface will take it from there!

NOTE: For security reasons, you should run the /setup command within 24 hours of adding Appy to your server. If you fail to do this, the bot may remove itself from your server.
